     Whilst <span class = 'regional'>2020</span> may have began like every other year, the year was filled with events truly like no other. 
     Our Own Premier, Daniel Andrews, dubbed the events that occured in <span class = 'regional'>2020</span> as a "1 in 100 year event".
     With the introduction of the COVID-19 disease, there were a range of changes to the very way of life that we were typically used to. Melbourne in particular had experienced a range of different lockdowns in order to prevent the widespread transmission of the disease. 
     In total Melbourne spent 153 days in <span class = 'regional'>2020</span> under different lockdown measures and as such we are examining how the effects of these lockdowns.
    affected mobility and thus vehicle accidents in <span class = 'regional'>2020</span>.

          The number of accidents has had quite a consistent trend in relation to the number of accidents that has occured over time in Victoria.
          Whilst, this might vary or fluctuate depending on seasonal events, for example increased tourist travel to the Grampians during school holidays or slight reductions in December due to Christmas Break.
          A structural break is an unexpected change over time & we can clearly identify below that <span class = 'regional'>2020</span> showed to have a clear structral break in the trend associated with Vehicle Accidents.
          The introduction of Coronavirus to Victorian shores began through Patient-Zero in Melbourne was a man from Wuhan, who flew to Melbourne from Guandong, China on 19 January. Given the unknown risk of the virus & insufficient health care systems to handle a widespread epidemic, government restrictions were implemented once the real threat of the virus was known.

          Not only are government restrictions great for reducing the amount of transmission of the virus, but the inherent implication of government restrictions have in turn resulted in a <span class = 'bonkers'>substantial reduction in the monthly averages.</span>
         <br>
         <br>
          The total number of accidents despite varying quite minimally in previous years has seen a dramatic decrease in the  average  amount of monthly accidents in <span class = 'regional'>2020</span>

          It is noted that   <span class = 'bonkers'> <span class = 'regional'>January 2020 was the only month that followed the seasonal pattern that previous years did in fact have.</span> </span>
          Taking this into consideration it is noted that <span class = 'lockdown1'>Lockdown 1</span> that occured during the period of <span class = 'bonkers'>31st of March to 12th of May.</span> 
          Restrictions such as "Work from home" & shutdowns of non essential activities.
          These dates coallign with the <span class = 'bonkers'>break in the previous trends in the months of February-April.</span> <span class = 'lockdown2'>Lockdown 2</span>, which last 110 days implemented the "4 reasons to leave your home" which then saw a  <span class = 'bonkers'>continued decreasing trend in accidents </span> following these dates.

          Time & Day Difference in The Number of Accidents between  <span class = 'vehicle_text'>2020</span> vs Previous Years

        <p class="annotate-left">
          <br>
          Based off of the previous two graphs, we can identify that there was a tremendous decrease in the level of vehicle accidents in <span class = 'regional'>2020</span>.
          The total number of accidents in  <span class = "bonkers"><span class = 'regional'>2020 was 6,060 </span></span> compared to <span class = "bonkers">2019 which had 14,164 vehicle accidents</span>
          We know that there was a noticeable effect of the two lockdowns that resulted in a monthly decrease in accidents that co-aligned with the lockdown dates.
          If we did abit deep we can further see the effect of substantial changes in the amount of accidents due to reductions in peak hour traffic. The Period associated with a workday, commonly known as a "9-5" was 
          shown to have the most <span class = "bonkers">substantial decrease in incidents. </span> As stated before, things like "Working From Home if you can" changed the landscape of those travelling to the city.
          Furthermore with the inherent addition of a governmental curfew from 8pm to 5am & travel limits of 5km, this effect is noticeably seen through the <span class = "bonkers">reduction in accidents </span> over the late night on the weekends, as well as weekends in general.

            Another interesting elements in relation to the pandemic measures implement in <span class = 'bonkers'> 2020 </span> was the division between between <span class = 'regional'>Metropolitan Victoria</span> & <span class = 'Metro_anno'>Regional Victoria</span>.
            Whilst lockdown 1 which dated the period of 31st of March to 12th of May had universal rules for both regions, Lockdown 2 , which started from 9th of July to 27th of October had a different set of rules.
            A ring of steel was the key feature of Melbourne's harshest restrictions last year, as police-staffed highway checkpoints attempted to prevent people from <span class = 'regional'>Metropolitan Victoria</span> entering  <span class = 'Metro_anno'>Regional Victoria</span> without exemptions.
            With differing rules based on differing milestones, <span class = 'Metro_anno'>Regional Victoria</span> experienced more freedoms than average Victorians from the <span class = 'regional'>Metropolitan Region</span>.
             As such this has in turn caused a <span class = 'bonkers'> disproportional change in the number of accidents per region </span> & how these correlate to previous trends.

          <br>
          In  Summary we can learn the following in relation to the effect that lockdowns had on vehicle accidents between  <span class = 'regional'>Metropolitan</span> and the <span class = 'Metro_anno'>Regional Victoria</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          Relative to Previous Years the total makeup of accidents had more of a percentage attributed to those that occured in <span class = 'Metro_anno'> Regional Victoria </span> with almost a <span class = 'bonkers'> 11% increase relative to 2019. </span>
        
          It also recorded its first year with a<span class = 'bonkers'> greater than 30% proportion of total accidents</span>
          <br>
          <br>
          <span class = 'Metro_anno'>Regional Victoria</span> had a disproportionately different reaction to the effects of the government measures relative to the <span class = 'regional'>Metropolitan Region.</span>
          We can visualise the notion that <span class = 'regional'>Metropolitan Regions</span> saw a significant percentage difference per LGA compared to <span class = 'Metro_anno'>Regional Victoria</span> in terms of accidents particularly compared to 2019.
          <br>
          <br>
          Finally, despite  <span class = 'Metro_anno'>Regional Victoria LGA's</span> having a lower amount of overall total accidents, the <span class = "bonkers"> total number of fatalities</span> compared to the <span class = 'regional'>Metropolitan Region.</span> had an almost equivalent if not higher total number per LGA.
          This was a substantial increase relative to previous years trends which implies that indeed the effect of different government measures had a <span class = "bonkers"> disproportionate affect on Vehicle Incidents </span> between the two regions.

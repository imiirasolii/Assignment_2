     Whilst 2020 may have began like every other year, the year was filled with events truly like no other. Our Own Premier, Daniel Andrews, dubbed the events that occured in 2020 as a "1 in 100 year event".
     With the introduction of the COVID-19 disease, there were a range of changes to the very way of life that we were typically used to. Melbourne in particular had experienced a range of different lockdowns in order to prevent the widespread transmission of the disease. In total Melbourne spent 153 days in 2020 under different lockdown measures and as such we are examining how the effects of these lockdowns 
    affected mobility and thus vehicle accidents in 2020.

          Not only are government restrictions great for reducing the amount of transmission of the virus, but the inherent implication of government restrictions have in turn resulted in a substantial reduction in the monthly averages.
          The total number of accidents despite varying quite minimally, irrespective of population growth, has seen a dramatic decrease in the  average  amount of monthly accidents in <span class = 'vehicle_text_annotation'>2020</span>

          Patient-Zero in Melbourne was a man from Wuhan, flew to Melbourne from Guandong on 19 January.  It is noted that January <span class = 'vehicle_text_annotation'>2020</span> was the only month that followed the seasonal pattern that previous years did in fact have.
          Taking this into consideration it is noted that the first lockdown during the period of 31st of March to 12th of May. Restrictions such as "Work from home" & shutdowns of non essential activities.
          These dates coallign with the break in the previous trends in the months of February-April. Lockdown 2, which last 110 days implemented the "4 reasons to leave your home" which then saw a continued decreasing trend in accidents following these dates.

        <p class="annotate-left">
          Based off of the previous two visualisations, we can identify that there was a tremendous decrease in the level of vehicle accidents in <span class = 'vehicle_text'>2020</span>.
          We know that there was a noticeable effect of the two lockdowns that resulted in a monthly decrease in accidents that co-aligned with the lockdown dates.
          If we did abit deep we can further see the effect of substantial changes in the amount of accidents. The Period associated with a workday, commonly known as a "9-5" was 
          shown to have the most substantial decrease in incidents. As stated before, things like "Working From Home if you can" changed the landscape of those travelling to the city.
          Furthermore with the inherent addition of a governmental curfew & travel limits of 5km, this effect is noticeably seen through the reduction in accidents over the late night on the weekends, as well as weekends in general

            Another interesting elements in relation to the pandemic measures implement in <span class = 'vehicle_text'> 2020 </span> was the division between between Metropolitan Victoria & Regional Victoria
            Whilst lockdown 1 which dated the period of 31st of March to 12th of May had universal rules for both Metropolitan melbourne, Lockdown 2 , which started from 9th of July to 27th of October had a different set of rules.
            A ring of steel was the key feature of Melbourne's harshest restrictions last year, as police-staffed highway checkpoints attempted to prevent people from Melbourne entering the regional area of victoria without exemptions.
            With differing rules based on differing milestones, Regional Victoria experienced more freedoms than average Victorians from the Metropolitan Region. As such this has in turn caused a disproportional change in the number of accidents & how these correlate to previous trends.

          <p class="annotate-weft"> 
          In  Summary we can learn the following in relation to the effect that lockdowns had on vehicle accidents between Metropolitan and the Regional victoria.
          <br>
          <br>

          Relative to Previous Years the total makeup of accidents had more of a percentage attributed to those that occured in Regional Victoria with almost a 11% increase relative to 2019.
          It also recorded its first year with a greater than 30% proportion of total accidents compared since before 2006.
          <br>
          <br>
          Regional Victoria had a disproportionately different reaction to the effects of the government measures relative to Melbourne Region.
          We can visualise the notion that Metropolitan regions saw a significant percentage difference per LGA in terms of accidents particularly compared to 2019.
          <br>
          <br>
          Finally, despite regional Victoria having a lower amount of Total accidents, the number of fatalities compared to Metropolitan melbourne had an almost equivalent if not higher total number.
          From this we can ascertain that indeed the effect of different government measures had a disproportionate affect on Vehicle Incidents between the two regions.
